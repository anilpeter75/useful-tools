# Useful Tools :mag_right: 

_This is a list of useful tools and programs for developpers, devops, admins, ... but not only.
Whereas most of them are Open Source, not all of them are. Please check licences that may apply.
This list contains items that i **personally** find useful, usages may differ._

The concept behind that list is based on the famous "[awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)" lists you can find on github. 
Since they did not fully suited my need, i preferred to go with my own version.

- You can find this project on [Github](https://github.com/trolologuy/useful-tools) <iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=trolologuy&repo=useful-tools&type=star&count=true&size=small" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="90" height="20" title="Star Useful Tools on GitHub"></iframe>
- If you want to find out more about me and my projects, you can find my [portfolio here](https://trolologuy.github.io/)

Please feel free to comment or open a pull request if you know better tools / or alternatives or if some links are dead, ... 😉
